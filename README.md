Electrange, an electric sheep for macOS.

A "desktop pet", based on the old "esheep.exe" for Windows. It was built by
tasking claude code (Opus 4.5) with porting functionality from
https://github.com/Adrianotiger/desktopPet over to macOS, and then lots of
iteration from there. It only supports the original eSheep animations (and only
a subset), and only walks around on the bottom of the screen, although it will
attempt to jump on your dock. It makes me smile. There may be more in the future.

Installation:

Currently you'll have to build it yourself with Xcode in order to run it. There
are no signed binary releases.
